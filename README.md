# Hi, I'm Francesco Benedetto ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŽ“ **Educational Background**

I'm currently studying *Information Bioengineering MSc* at *Politecnico di Milano*. My focus is on applying machine learning and deep learning techniques in the biomedical field, primarily working with signals and images, as well as **natural language processing (NLP)** in healthcare.

ðŸ§ª **Thesis Project**  

At the moment, I'm deeply involved in my thesis project, which focuses on **instance-level cell generation** using **Generative AI** techniques. This work combines the latest advances in generative deep lerning modeling with the nuanced requirements of biomedical applications.

ðŸ“Œ **Some Interesting Projects**

- **[Suspected Pneumonia Mortality Prediction Model](https://github.com/FrancescoBenedetto99/Suspected-Pneumonia--SLHD_PROJECT)**: A predictive model designed to estimate the mortality risk of critically ill patients suspected of pneumonia, leveraging clinical data to understand key factors influencing patient outcomes.
  
- **[Street Flooding Simulation](https://github.com/FrancescoBenedetto99/Street-Flooding-Problem--ML_PROJECT_2)**:   A machine learning model that predicts flood outcomes based on initial environmental conditions, aimed at replicating a flood simulator's predictions and understanding the underlying causes of flooding events.


ðŸ’¼ **Skills & Tools**

Hereâ€™s a quick overview of the programming languages, libraries, and tools I'm currently proficient in, with plans to expand further:
